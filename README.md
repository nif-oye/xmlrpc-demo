# XML-RPC Demo
A simple XML-RPC implementation in Python. This project includes:
- A basic XML-RPC server (`server.py`) that registers a function to respond to client requests.
- A client (`client.py`) that connects to the server and sends a greeting message.

Run the server first, then execute the client to see the remote procedure call in action.
