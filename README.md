# XML-RPC Demo  
A simple demonstration of XML-RPC in Python, designed to practice concepts from [MIT's Computer Systems Engineering: Operating Systems Part I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/pages/week-1/).

## Overview
This project includes:
- **Server (`server.py`)**: A basic XML-RPC server that registers a function to handle client requests.  
- **Client (`client.py`)**: A client program that connects to the server and sends a greeting message using remote procedure calls.

## How to Run
1. Start the server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```
2. Run the client in a separate terminal:
   ```
   python client.py
   ```

## Learning Context
This project was created to reinforce concepts learned from [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu) lectures on computer system engineering, specifically the fundamentals of remote procedure calls (RPCs).
